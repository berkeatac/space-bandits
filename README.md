Space Bandits is a real time multiplayer game, that runs on a browser and uses socket.io to create real time communicaiton between the users and the server. The goal is to get the most points by hovering over the planets and sucking them to death.


### Tech

Space Bandits uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* P5.js - JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences
* Twitter Bootstrap - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* node.js - evented I/O for the backend
* Express - fast node.js network app framework
* socket.io - enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.


### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd space_bandits
$ npm install -d
$ node server.js
```
